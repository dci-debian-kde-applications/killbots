Description: port of the classic BSD console game robots
 killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. The robots are numerous 
 and their sole objective is to destroy you.  Fortunately for you, their 
 creator has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result 
 the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. Your superior wit and 
 a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the never-ending 
 stream of mindless automatons.
